# Tasks

There are three tasks which are part of this assignment.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---



## Proposal

The first task is to distribute the students among the various major portions of the project: FrontEnd (UX / UI), BackEnd and Database, and Visualization, and designate your team leader(s).  Also, you should create a contact information spreadsheet in your new Google team drive, and establish your means for collaboration.  We will finalize team assignments during the second week of class.  In addition, I will try to honor the requests for those of you who expressed interest in leading a team, as well as the overall project lead.  Again, we will determine this by the second week of class.

Your team should then write a 2-4 page report describing your chosen/assigned task(s).  In order to properly define your team's work, you will need  to arrange meetings and hold conversations with your clients (Drs. Druen and Shedlosky), as well as familiarize yourself with the current state of the project through previous team members, and the Privilege Walk Final Tech Report from CS482-Spring2023.

Your team project proposal report should include the following information:

-   Who are the members of your team (you may work on multiple teams)?
-   What is the URL of the main repository for your project (see the GitHub task below)?
-   What is the current state of the system that you will be working on?
-   What problem is solved by the system your team will implement?
-   What are the major technical challenges you will face?
-   What technologies (programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware devices, etc.) will you use in the implementation of the system, and WHY are you choosing them (what are their advantages over other possible choices)?
-   What kind of user interface will the system have?

Use drawings, block diagrams, wire frames, screen captures, as appropriate, to convey this information clearly.

### Please Talk To Us!

You **must** meet with your York College Psychology program clients (Drs. Druen and Shedlosky) to discuss project ideas, tasks, and priorities before you submit and present your formal project proposal.  And certainly feel free to contact your instructor for guidance and clarification on the requirements for this assignment.

You will be given access to the Privilege Walk Team Drive from Fa21-Sp22.  Start with the Privilege Walk Final Tech Report, and contact the previous team members for thie input and guidance.

## Set up a GitHub repository and create a shared Google Team Drive for your project, with appropriate folder structure.

Your second task is to extend the existing shared Privilege Walk Shared Google Team Drive and the repositories for your project on [GitHub](https://github.com).

You should add all of your team members as contributors to the repository.  Also, add the instructor (GitHub user [DonaldHakeII](https://github.com/DonaldHakeII).

In the issue tracker for the main repository, review the existing issues and work that has been accompished.  Work with the previous team members to establish a label and color-coding system for the following three labels:

-   **Feature** - indicates a planned feature to be implemented
-   **Bug** - indicates a problem with code that needs to be addressed
-   **In-progress (with individual initials)** - indicates which tasks are currently assigned to and/or being worked on by each team member.

Your team may add additional labels as desired.

## Set up your computing environment

Your third task is for each team member to set up a computing environment with the hardware and software they will need for the project.  **AND to have the current Privilege Walk Application up and runnning on each of your development PCs.**

You may use the physical space and computing equipment as you see fit.  Please be considerate of the needs of other teams, and please try to keep the environment neat and well-organized.  The back two benches of KEC 118 are reserved for the Radio Telescope team.  The remaining 3 benches are open for the other teams in CS400.

Please note that you are **NOT** required to use one of the provided lab PCs: you can use your own laptop, if you would prefer.  Given the uncertainty of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, I **highly** recommend that you work on your own laptops so that any transition to remote learning (if it comes) can be relatively seamless.  We will be conducting in-person meetings, while utilizing Zoom so that Dr. Druen can attend.  These will occur in KEC 123, so you'll need to be able to transport your work to that room for demonstration purposes.
