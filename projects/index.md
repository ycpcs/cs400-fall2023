## Privilege Walk Project Description
The Privilege Walk exercise demonstrates how your specific collection of characteristics, aspects, and events in your life can accelerate or hinder your progress and achievments in life, relative to other people with a different collection of those charactersitics, aspects, and events.  It is intended to initiate and facilitate a meaningful dialog on impacts of privilege, diversity, and inclusion among various groups of people.

Here are links to two descriptions of the Privilege Walk exercise:
  - [OpenSource.com Privilege Walk Exercise](https://opensource.com/open-organization/17/11/privilege-walk-exercise)
  - [EIU Privilege Walk Exercise](https://www.eiu.edu/eiu1111/Privilege%20Walk%20Exercise-%20Transfer%20Leadership%20Institute-%20Week%204.pdf)

This is the second year for the Privilege Walk project, with two faculty members from the York College Psychology program serving as your clients: [Dr. Perri Druen](https://www.ycp.edu/academics/school-of-behavioral-sciences-and-education/faculty/druen-perri.php) and [Dr. Randi Shedlosky](https://www.ycp.edu/academics/school-of-behavioral-sciences-and-education/faculty/shedlosky-shoemaker-randi.php).  You will find their initial project requirements [here](PrivilegeWalkApplicationDescription.pdf).

You will be continuing development of this project, building upon the accomplishments of last year's CS Senior Design I (CS481) and CS Senior Design II (CS482) teams.  You will acquire the information for your project proposal, Use Cases and User Stories, and Requirements from your clients, as well as from the prior team's progress (Final Technical Report from CS482).  Your clients will also establish your tasks and priorities in consultation with me, and with your input, as you plan and develop the sprint schedule for your agile development approach.

This project will likely break into 2-3 teams, across 3-5 people (team members can be on multiple teams):
- Front End (UI / UX)
- Backend and Database
- Data Visualization

It is highly likely that this will be a two-semester project, spanning both CS400 (Fall 2022) and CS402 (Spring 2023).  I highly recommend that you continue working on this project in CS402 in the Spring, as it will provide you with a valuable year-long, comprehensive, client-based, team project experience, and CS402 counts as a CS elective toward your CS major requirements.
