## Blockhouse RFQ Project Description
Josh Manieri (IT Director) from [Blockhouse](https://blockhouse.com) reached out to us regarding a possible project.  Here are the salient details from his email.

> I am reaching out on behalf of Blockhouse, a York-based furniture manufacturer with an almost entirely self-hosted Linux & Windows-based IT environment on-site that we are continuing to modernize. We actually have an extensive amount of our furniture placed across York College's campus! I am writing to inquire about the possibility of Blockhouse participating in your esteemed university's senior capstone project for the computer science department.

> We have been thoroughly impressed with one of your student's academic rigor and the innovative projects he's completed with us thus far, and he has brought to my attention that some collaboration here could prove mutually beneficial. As a company, we are eager to support and contribute to the development of the next generation of computer science professionals, especially those in our local community. Participating in your senior capstone project would offer our team valuable insights into the challenges students are tackling, while providing students with real-world experience and industry exposure.

> The primary project I'm more inclined towards for capstone involves the development of a web-accessible Request-for-Quote (RFQ) system tailored to our Inside Sales team's needs. With 16 Sales Representatives and 3 Sales Coordinators, the current process involves the completion of multiple PDF forms for product quotation purposes. The envisaged web application streamlines this workflow by compiling essential information from the RFQ process and seamlessly integrating it with our CRM and ERP systems over RESTful APIs, enhancing overall efficiency and accuracy of the RFQ process here.

The Blockhouse RFQ Project will likely be a single team of 3-4 members focusing mainly on the RFQ Front-End development, but will also involved interfacing with their existing CRM and ERP systems, as described above.

This project will span at least two semesters: CS400 (Fall 2023) and CS402 (Spring 2024).  We highly recommend that you continue working on this project in CS402 in the Spring, as it will provide you with a valuable year-long, comprehensive, client-based, team project experience, and CS402 counts as a CS elective toward your CS major requirements.
