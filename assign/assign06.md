# Your Task

Your task is to demonstrate a 50% working version of your system.

# The Demonstration

Each project team should plan to present for 45 to 60 minutes.  Larger teams (with multiple sub-teams) will likely go longer than that. There will likely also be an extensive question and answer period.  All presentations need to be limited to less than two hours (including the questions and answer period).

You should use some presentation software such as PowerPoint or a Google presentation. Your slides should contain brief bulleted points and graphics that provide overall context for your bullet points. Slides should not be a "wall of text", and please avoid reading your slides or a prepared script.

Your presentation should include the following elements:

- Demonstrate the system in action. If you have a UI, show it.
- Run your unit tests to demonstrate your testing framework, and describe what is happening.
- Explain what parts of your design are implemented, and which parts remain to be implemented by referencing your **updated** UML diagram and Database Schema. Briefly talk about how you plan to evolve the system to implement the remaining functionality.

**Plan your demonstration carefully.** You need to convince us that your system is 50% complete.  Make sure your demonstration convinces us!

**Please do a dry run before class.** Because of the limited amount of time we have in class, we can't wait for your team to troubleshoot issues that arise during the presentation..

# Grading

Your team grade will be determined as follows:

- Issue Tracker is being kept updated: **10%**
- Important system functionality is demonstrated: **50%**
- Demonstration of Unit tests: **15%**
- Discussion of how this functionality is implemented in the underlying object model, including updated UML diagram(s) and Database Schema: **15%**
- Discussion of how system will be evolved to add remaining functionality: **10%**
